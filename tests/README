===========================================================================
                    A GENERAL TEST SUITE FOR CIAO
===========================================================================

This is a general test suite for Ciao, which contains tests for the
language and its implementation, which allows measuring:

 - correctness of compiler, optimizer, analyzer, etc. (including
   parser, pretty print, output, ...)

 - performance (time, memory consumption) of the engine, runtime, libraries,
   compiler and analysis

 - comparison with other languages and implementations

Do not include unit tests in this directory (E.g., those that go in
their respective bundle).

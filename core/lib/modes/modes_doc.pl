:- doc(module,"This package defines a number of @concept{modes} which
   are frequently useful in programs when describing predicates, e.g.,
   via @decl{pred} assertions.  They correspond to the modes used in
   many classical Prolog texts and code as documentation, with some
   additions. However, these modes are actually syntactic sugar for
   assertions, that can be checked either statically or
   dynamically. Note that some of these modes use the same symbol as
   one of the @lib{basicmodes} and @lib{isomodes} packages (see
   @ref{Some basic Prolog modes} and @ref{ISO-Prolog modes}) but have
   in some cases subtly different meaning.

   As an example, the following declaration:

@begin{verbatim}
:- pred is(-,+).
@end{verbatim}

   Expresses that @pred{is/2} should be called with the second argument
   bound and it will bind the first argument. Also: 

@begin{verbatim}
:- pred is(-num,+arithexpression).
@end{verbatim}

   (more precise than the above), expresses that @pred{is/2} should be
   called with the second argument instantiated to an arithmetic
   expression and that on success it will bind the first argument to a
   number. The argument of a mode as above can be any property,
   including, e.g., regular types. 

   The first declaration is equivalent to (it is in fact translated
   to) the assertion:

@begin{verbatim}
:- pred is(X,Y) : nonvar(Y) => nonvar(X). 
@end{verbatim}

   and the second one to:

@begin{verbatim}
:- pred is(X,Y) : arithexpression(Y) => num(X). 
@end{verbatim}

   Modes can also be included inside comments in markdown format (see
   the @lib{doccomments} and @lib{markdown} libraries). For example:

@begin{verbatim}
%! pred is(-,+):
%  Evaluates the expression in the second argument
%  and binds the first argument with the result. 
@end{verbatim}

   and they are also translated to the corresponding assertions.").

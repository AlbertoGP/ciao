   contain formal specifications (such as sets of preconditions,

   This module is part of the @lib{assertions} library. It defines the
   basic code-related assertions, i.e., those intended to be used
   mainly by compilation-related tools, such as the static analyzer or
   the run-time test generator.

   Here we document mainly the use of assertions for providing
   @concept{specifications} for predicates and other program elements,
   as well as the locations within assertions where machine-readable
   documentation strings can be placed.  The commands that can be used
   in the documentation strings and other directives that can be used
   to provide additional machine-readable comments @cindex{comments,
   machine readable} are described in the autodocumenter (@apl{lpdoc}
   @cite{knuth-lit,lpdoc-tr}) manual.

   There are two kinds of assertions: predicate assertions and program
   point assertions.  Predicate assertions are placed as directives in
   the source code, i.e., preceded by ``@tt{:-}''.  Program point
   assertions are placed as literals in clause bodies.  Additional
   documentation on the syntax and fields of predicate assertions can
   be found in the @ref{Types and properties related to assertions}
   module.

   The assertion language as implemented in this library essentially follows these
   documents, although, due to its evolution, it may differ in some
   details. The purpose of this manual is to document precisely what
   the implementation of the library supports at any given point in
   time.

   @section{Some attention points} 

   @begin{itemize}

   @item @bf{Formatting commands within text strings:} @cindex{formatting
   commands} many of the predicates defined in these modules include
   arguments intended for providing textual information. This includes
   titles, descriptions, comments, etc. The type of this argument is a
   character string. In order for the automatic generation of
   documentation to work correctly, this @concept{character string}
   should adhere to certain conventions. See the description of the
   @pred{docstring/1} type/grammar for details.

   @item @bf{Referring to variables:} In order for the automatic
   documentation system to work correctly, @concept{variable names}
   (for example, when referring to arguments in the head patterns of
   @em{pred} declarations) must be surrounded by an @tt{@@var}
   command. For example, @tt{@@var@{VariableName@}} should be used for
   referring to the variable ``VariableName'', which will appear then
   formatted as follows: @var{VariableName}. See the description of
   the @pred{docstring/1} type/grammar for details.

:- doc(pred/1, "@cindex{pred assertion} @tt{pred} assertions are the
    most general type of assertion, and they are used to provide
    information on the set of admissible calls to a predicate, the set
    of successes, global properties, and documentation.  The body of a
    @tt{pred} assertion (its only argument) contains properties or
    comments in different fields following the formats specified by
    @pred{assrt_body/1}.

    There can be more than one of these assertions per predicate, in
    which case each one represents a possible ``@concept{mode}'' of
    use (@concept{usage}) of the predicate. The exact scope of the
    usage is defined by the properties given for calls in the body of
    each assertion (which should thus distinguish the different usages
    intended). Predicates are typically specified using a @em{set} of
    @tt{pred} assertions, so that together they cover all ways in
    which the predicate is intended be used (all usages). Each
    @tt{pred} assertion is translated internally to a @tt{calls}
    assertion covering all the calling modes and a @tt{success}
    assertion covering the successes for those calls.

    For example, the following assertions would describe all intended
    modes (and the only modes) of use of a predicate @tt{length/2}
    (see @lib{lists}):
    @begin{verbatim}
:- pred length(L,N) : list * var => list * integer
    # ""Computes the length of @var{L}."".
:- pred length(L,N) : var * integer => list * integer
    # ""Outputs @var{L} of length @var{N}."".
:- pred length(L,N) : list * integer => list * integer

    is present (i.e., in @pred{pred/1} assertions) the status is
    assumed to be @tt{check}.

    For example, the following assertion:
     @begin{verbatim}
:- pred length(L,N) : list * var => list * integer.
     @end{verbatim}

    Properties are standard predicates, but which are @em{guaranteed
    to terminate for any possible instantiation state of their
    argument(s)}, do not perform side-effects which may interfere with
    the program behaviour, and do not further instantiate their
    arguments or add new constraints.

    Provided the above holds, properties can thus be safely used as
    @concept{run-time checks}. The program transformation used in
    @tt{ciaopp} for run-time checking guarantees the third
    requirement.  It also performs some basic checks on properties
    which in most cases are enough for the second
    requirement. However, it is the user's responsibility to guarantee
    termination of the properties defined.  (See also @ref{Declaring
    regular types} for some considerations applicable to writing
    properties.)

    The set of properties is thus a strict subset of the set of
